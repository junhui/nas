## Steps to Transfer Your Hard Drives

### 1. Check Drive Compatibility

Before transferring, ensure your hard drives are compatible with the new Synology NAS model.

- **Identical NAS Models**: If the new NAS is the same model as the old one, proceed to the next step.
- **Different NAS Models**: Consult Synology's [HDD/SSD compatibility list](https://www.synology.com/en-us/compatibility) to verify compatibility. Generally, Seagate IronWolf or WD Red drives are compatible with Synology NAS devices manufactured after 2015. For HDDs exceeding 8TB, ensure compatibility with NAS models released after 2021.
